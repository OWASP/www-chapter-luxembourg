This talk will walk through using the ASVS: 
•	as a metric - Provide application developers and application owners with a yardstick with which to assess the degree of trust that can be placed in their Web applications,
•	as guidance - Provide guidance to security control developers as to what to build into security controls in order to satisfy application security requirements, and
•	during procurement - Provide a basis for specifying application security verification requirements in contracts.
